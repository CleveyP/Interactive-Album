# Interactive-Album
This project is a series of web pages that are linked and all share the same basic html skeleton. To start experienceing the content on any one page:
Click the audio element located near the bottom left of the page. This will start playing one of my compositions (composed and also performed and or programmed in post)
This will also start to fade in a poem I wrote to accompany the composition and possibly enable some css animations that are unique to the page. 
To explore all pages, the user must navigate from page to page by pressing a uniquely named button located underneath the Hero element.
